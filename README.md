- Also, install [FFMPEG](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg).
- Also, you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager and use it instead.

- Clone this repository and then get in the newly created folder.

- In the project directory run `yarn` or `npm i` to install dependencies.

- Now use `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.
